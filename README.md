1:used recycler view to load the data as we scroll down...
2:used sqllite database for light usage adn it is deployed in your own mobile only.. for authentication...
3:used adapter class for the recycler view ..
4:it uses mvc type appproach to pull the data and present on the screen ...
5:hardcoded the data ih the object of the adapter class data to be passed on but should populate the data using the database 
as it is the best practise..
6:used the authetication of the inbuilt methods for chechking of the strings which it takes from the user as input ...
7:only takes input of the username as email only but not as any other format...
8:finally it is the basic one having used multiple concepts but i would likke to add more functionality in future...like using firebase,notifications,etc...
