1 : Used recycler view to load the data as we scroll down... <br/>
2 : Used sqllite database for light usage adn it is deployed in your own mobile only.. for authentication... <br/>
3 : Used adapter class for the recycler view .. <br/>
4 : It uses mvc type appproach to pull the data and present on the screen ... <br/>
5 : Hardcoded the data ih the object of the adapter class data to be passed on but should populate the data using the database 
as it is the best practise.. <br/>
6 : Used the authetication of the inbuilt methods for checking of the strings which it takes from the user as input ... <br/>
7 : Only takes input of the username as email only but not as any other format... <br/>
8 : Finally it is the basic one having used multiple concepts but i would like to add more functionality in future...like using firebase,notifications,etc... <br/>
